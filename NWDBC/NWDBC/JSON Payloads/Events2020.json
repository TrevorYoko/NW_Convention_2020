Over the past 30 years this has changed drastically. However, without understanding what creates a temple’s culture, our temples and thus BCA cannot succeed. \"Compassion, Gratitude, Community\" is the theme for this year’s Northwest District Convention. There is a great deal of misunderstanding between compassion in a general sense and the Jodo Shinshu understanding of compassion. Our temples are not dispensers of compassion, merely the recipients. In developing our temple cultures, it is important that we develop a culture based upon Jodo Shinshu teachings and how we live a life of gratitude. In this way, we may create temples with a culture of gratitude and community.",

Together, let us look at how Shinran Shonin, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, came to understand and receive the compassion of Amida Buddha. It is only when we understand the true source of compassion, that we can then move forward in our lives in the dynamic reality of compassionate activity.",

At a time of loss and dislocation, our Dharma ancestors drew on fundamental Buddhist teachings of dynamic change and interdependence to foster an orientation to the world that helped them recognize that they were not alone in the world.\n\nStories from the past inspires us to see the timeless Buddhist virtues of a compassionate heart as we see how helping others is interlinked to our own well-being; a sense of gratitude towards all that sustain our life; and the building of a Sangha community that strengthens and enhances our Buddhist practice. From building Buddhist altars from desert wood to using guard tower searchlights for meditation practice, we’ll also learn from the wartime stories about how to make the best out of what is karmically available to us and to achieve freedom even in the midst of a state of non-freedom.",
